COMP 2659
Details:
This is the final Atari game. I did not track each game stage. 

Issues:
	- The mouse moves slowly in the main menu because I redraw the buffer every frame. 
	- Double def of _enable_channel in isr_asm.o (???)
Feedback:
	- Use less / no global.c
	- _enable_channel error does not matter
	- Mouse position update / draw should be in ISR. Should function independently from the program.
