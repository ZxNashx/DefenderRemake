Details:
This is the hand-in for the second check-in containing project
stages 2,3 and 4. 

The MAKEFILE will create TOS programs that test different sections of code.



PROGRAM:
	graphicsTestDriver.tos

DESCRIPTION: 
This is the program to render basic shapes on the screen related to
project stage II (raster).



PROGRAM:
	modelTestDriver.tos

DESCRIPTION: 
This is the program to test the model and events files created in project 
stage III (model & events). ("modelt~1.tos >> output.txt" works well)



PROGRAM:
	renderTestDriver.tos

DESCRIPTION: 
This is the program to test the renderer module from project stage IV (renderer).
There are some sprites rendered and moved across the screen. 



Notes:
The majority of the function documentation in the .h files.
Confusing sections of code in the .c files were also documented. 

Issues:
- "make clean" does not work, must manually "rm *.o" and "rm *.tos".
